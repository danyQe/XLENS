# xlens - Twitter Controller Agent

## Overview
**xlens** is a Twitter controller agent built using the Crewai framework. It performs several tasks such as sentiment analysis, fact-checking, and viral tweet generation. The agent autonomously analyzes and interacts with Twitter content, aiming to enhance engagement and provide meaningful insights based on trending topics.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of tweets to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Fact-Checking**: Cross-checks the information in tweets to verify its accuracy.
- **Viral Tweet Generation**: Generates tweets with the potential to go viral, based on current trends and topics.
- **Autonomous Posting**: The agent autonomously posts tweets based on analysis and character.

## Requirements
Before running the setup, make sure you have the following:
- Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
- A Twitter Developer account and API keys (for Twitter integration).
- Internet connection for dependencies installation and data fetching.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up **xlens**:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the **xlens** project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xlens.git
cd xlens
```

### 2. Run `setup.bat`
The `setup.bat` file automates the setup process, including installing dependencies and configuring environment variables.

- Navigate to the project folder where `setup.bat` is located.
- Double-click on `setup.bat` to run it.
  - This will install all the required Python dependencies and set up any necessary environment variables.
  
### 3. Configure Twitter API Keys
Make sure you have the Twitter API keys. You can obtain them from your [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/).

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following environment variables to `.env`:

```plaintext
X_API_KEY=your_api_key
X_API_KEY_SECRET=your_api_secret_key
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
```

### 4. Verify Setup
Once the setup script finishes, you can verify the installation by running the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```




This will initialize the agent and begin performing tasks like sentiment analysis, fact-checking, and tweet generation based on Twitter trends.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
- Ensure you have the correct Python version installed.
- Double-check your Twitter API credentials in the `.env` file.
- Check the logs for error messages that may indicate missing dependencies or configuration errors.
